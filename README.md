# Statistical Inference Course

## Assignment 1
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that "the distribution of averages of indipendent and identically distributed (iid) variables becomes that of a standard normal as the sample size increase." so in this assignment it will be investigate the behaviour of the exponential distribution when looking at the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials (and more).

## Assignment 2
The goal is to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package, performing some exploratory analysis, and then use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.
